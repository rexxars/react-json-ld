## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use the [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/rexxars/react-safe-json-ld/security/advisories/new) feature in GitHub to report any security issues.

You can normally expect an update within a week on a reported vulnerability, but as this is an open-source project with a single maintainer, I cannot _guarantee_ this response time. For the same reason, I am unable to provide any financial reward for the reports.
